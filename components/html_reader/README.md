# Component Name
HtmlReader

# Description
The HtmlReader component is a building block of a Yeager Workflow, designed to fetch and return the HTML content of a specified URL. It is a Python class that inherits from the AbstractComponent base class and overrides the transform() method to process input URL and return the fetched HTML content as output.

# Input and Output Models
- **Input Model:** `HtmlReaderInputDict` - A Pydantic BaseModel with the following fields:
  - `url` (str): The URL of the web page to fetch.

- **Output Model:** `HtmlReaderOutputDict` - A Pydantic BaseModel with the following fields:
  - `html_content` (str): The fetched HTML content of the given URL.

# Parameters
- `user_agent` (str): The user agent string used in the request headers when making an HTTP request to the provided URL.
- `timeout` (int): The maximum duration (in seconds) to wait for a response from the URL before giving up.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` function of the HtmlReader component performs the following steps:
1. Constructs an HTTP request header containing the `user_agent` property.
2. Makes an HTTP GET request to the provided URL (`args.url`) using the headers and the specified `timeout`.
3. Extracts the HTML content of the response.
4. Returns an `HtmlReaderOutputDict` object containing the extracted HTML content (`html_content` property).

# External Dependencies
The HtmlReader component relies on the following external libraries:
- `requests`: Handles the actual HTTP GET request to fetch the HTML content.
- `pydantic`: Defines input and output models with validation and serialization methods.
- `fastapi`: Provides FastAPI support for the transform endpoint.
- `dotenv`: Parses configurations from the `.env` file.
- `yaml`: Parses configurations from the `component.yaml` file.

# API Calls
- `requests.get` is used to make an HTTP GET request to the given URL. The purpose of this call is to fetch the HTML content of the page.

# Error Handling
The HtmlReader component does not implement specific error handling for exceptions thrown by external libraries such as `requests`. However, any exceptions will be propagated up to the caller and should be handled in the surrounding workflow.

# Examples
Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the HtmlReader component within a Yeager Workflow.

1. Set up the necessary configurations in the `.env` and `component.yaml` files.
2. Instantiate the HtmlReader component:
