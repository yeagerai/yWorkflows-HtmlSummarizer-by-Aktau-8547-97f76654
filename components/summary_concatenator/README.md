# Component Name

SummaryConcatenator

# Description

The SummaryConcatenator component is designed to concatenate summaries generated by the Gpt3Summarizer component in a Yeager Workflow. It takes a list of Gpt3SummarizerOutput objects as input and returns a single HtmlSummarizerOutputModel object containing the concatenated summaries.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

- `input_list`: List of `Gpt3SummarizerOutput` objects
  - `summary`: A summarized text (string), generated by the Gpt3Summarizer component

## Output Model

- `HtmlSummarizerOutputModel`
  - `concatenated_summary`: Contains the concatenated summaries (string)

# Parameters

- `concatenation_separator`: A string that separates the concatenated summaries. It is loaded from the component's configuration file as a parameter.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method processes the list of input `Gpt3SummarizerOutput` objects and concatenates their summaries using the concatenation separator:

1. Initialize an empty string `concatenated_summary`.
2. Iterate over the input list.
3. Add each summary to the `concatenated_summary` string.
4. If the current item is not the last one in the list, add the `concatenation_separator`.
5. Return an `HtmlSummarizerOutputModel` object containing the `concatenated_summary`.

# External Dependencies

- `pydantic`: Used for creating input and output data models (`BaseModel`).
- `yaml`: For reading the component's configuration file.
- `fastapi`: For creating the FastAPI app and handling requests.

# API Calls

This component does not make external API calls.

# Error Handling

The component does not have explicit error handling, as the input models handle validation of the data structure. If a field does not match the required data type, the `BaseModel` validation from `pydantic` will raise an error.

# Examples

To use the SummaryConcatenator component within a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Configure the component by creating a configuration file (e.g., `summary_concatenator.yaml`) with the following content:
